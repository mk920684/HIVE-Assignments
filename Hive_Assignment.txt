1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location
ANS:
--To create dir
hadoop fs -mkdir /input_data

--Load data to hdfs
hadoop fs -put /config/workspace/sales_order_data.csv /input_data


3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
ANS:

create table sales_order_csv(ORDERNUMBER int, QUANTITYORDERED int , PRICEEACH int, ORDERLINENUMBER int , SALES int ,STATUS string, QTR_ID int, MONTH_ID int, YEAR_ID int, PRODUCTLINE string, MSRP int, PRODUCTCODE string, PHONE int, CITY string, STATE string, POSTALCODE int, COUNTRY string, TERRITORY string, CONTACTLASTNAME string, CONTACTFIRSTNAME string, DEALSIZE string)
    row format delimited
    fields terminated by ','
	tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count" = "1");


4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 
ANS:

load data local inpath '/input_data/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;


5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
ANS:

create table sales_order_orc(ORDERNUMBER int, QUANTITYORDERED int , PRICEEACH int, ORDERLINENUMBER int , SALES int ,STATUS string, QTR_ID int, MONTH_ID int, YEAR_ID int, PRODUCTLINE string, MSRP int, PRODUCTCODE string, PHONE int, CITY string, STATE string, POSTALCODE int, COUNTRY string, TERRITORY string, CONTACTLASTNAME string, CONTACTFIRSTNAME string, DEALSIZE string)
    stored as orc;

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

insert into sales_order_orc select * from sales_order_csv; 


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
ANS: Not sure total sales in terms of quantity or amount? Hence providing both query

select year_id,sum(sales) from sales_order_orc group by year_id;

select year_id,sum(QUANTITYORDERED) from sales_order_orc group by year_id;


b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
ANS:

Select A.productline from (Select sum(quantityordered) as maxorder,productline from
 sales_order_orc group by productline order by maxorder desc limit 1)A;

c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter

ANS:

Select sum(sales),qtr_id from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id;

d. In which quarter sales was minimum
ANS:

select sum(sales) as salesorder, qtr_id from sales_order_orc group by qtr_id order by salesorder limit 1;



e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
ANS:

SELECT A.country, A.sales FROM(SELECT country,Sales,RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sales) rnk_min,RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Sales DESC) rnk_max FROM sales_order_orc)A WHERE rnk_min = 1 OR rnk_max = 1 ORDER BY Sales;


f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
ANS:

Select sum(sales) as Quarter_sales, qtr_id, city from  sales_order_orc group by qtr_id, city;


h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
ANS:

select month_id,year_id,QUANTITYORDERED  from (select month_id,year_id,QUANTITYORDERED ,dense_rank() 
over(partition by year_id order by QUANTITYORDERED desc) as rnk from sales_order_csv)a where a.rnk =1;
